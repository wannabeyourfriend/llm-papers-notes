# LLM Papers Technical Notes

A curated collection of comprehensive technical notes and summaries for cutting-edge Large Language Model research papers.

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base for deep technical analysis of LLM research papers, with particular focus on:
- **Agentic Intelligence** - Models that can autonomously perceive, plan, reason, and act
- **Training Techniques** - Optimizers, data synthesis, post-training methods
- **Architecture Innovations** - MoE, attention mechanisms, scaling laws
- **Evaluation Benchmarks** - Coding, reasoning, tool use, safety

## 🎯 Papers Covered

### [1. Kimi K2: Open Agentic Intelligence](./papers/kimi-k2-open-agentic-intelligence/README.md)
- **arXiv**: 2507.20534
- **Authors**: Kimi Team (Moonshot AI)
- **Date**: July 2025 (v2: February 2026)
- **Key Contributions**:
  - MuonClip optimizer (stable 1T+ parameter training)
  - Large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline
  - General RL framework with verifiable and self-critique rewards
  - State-of-the-art open-source performance on agentic tasks

## 📖 How to Use

Each paper has its own directory containing:
- `README.md` - Comprehensive technical summary
- `notes.md` - Detailed notes with key insights
- `architecture/` - Architecture diagrams and visualizations
- `implementation-notes.md` - Practical implementation details
- `references.md` - Related papers and resources

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/llm-papers-notes.git
cd llm-papers-notes

# Navigate to a specific paper
cd papers/kimi-k2-open-agentic-intelligence

# Read the comprehensive summary
cat README.md
```

## 📝 Paper Selection Criteria

Papers are selected based on:
- **Novel technical contributions** (not just performance benchmarks)
- **Reproducibility potential** (sufficient implementation details)
- **Paradigm-shifting ideas** (fundamental advances, not incremental)
- **Open-source availability** (models, checkpoints, or code)
